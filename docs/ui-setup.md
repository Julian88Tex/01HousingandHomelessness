# UI Setup

To use the custom Lightning component, activate myDomain in your Salesforce org.. For more information, see [Set Up My Domain]( https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=domain_name_setup.htm&type=5).

The ReferralRecommendations page contains the Lightning component. Or you can add the component to a Contact page that you use in other apps.


1. In Lightning App Builder, open your contact page. Drag the custom component to the page.
2. Drag a flow component to the page and set it to the Client Profile Builder flow, and then use the checkbox to pass in the contactID as the recordId for the flow.
3. Add the Birthdate field to the Contact Page Layout if you havenâ€™t already.
