# Client Profile Builder flow

The Client Profile Builder flow template  makes three assumptions.

1. You capture client information on Contact.
2. You use the Other Address field to store the physical address.
3. You donâ€™t save employment/housing information in your Salesforce org.

You can easily customize the flow to do the following. 

1. Save the housing/employment information into a field in Salesforce.
2. Get address and date of birth information from locations other than the standard contact fields, or from other objects.
